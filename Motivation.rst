==========

OpenNLP was developed with the aim of easily fine-tuning open-source large language models in 2023. 

Large language models are utilized not only for simple text generation but also for various classification tasks. 

OpenNLP supports the overall process of adding an output layer for classification on top of large language models and utilizing it for classification tasks. 

On top of that, due to emerging massive LLMs, we added classes and functions for distributed learning across multiple GPUs. 

In fact, this software has been used for sentiment classification of the general public towards the US nuclear community.
